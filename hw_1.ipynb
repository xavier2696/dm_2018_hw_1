    "- First, you should attempt the **take home** exercises provided in the [notebook](https://github.com/omarsar/data_mining_lab/blob/master/news_data_mining.ipynb) we used for the first lab session. Attempt all the exercises, as it is counts towards the final grade of your first assignment (20%). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, download the dataset provided in this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences#). The sentiment dataset contains a `sentence` and `score` label. Read the specificiations of the dataset before you start exploring it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, you are asked to apply each of the data exploration and data operation steps learned in the [first lab session](https://github.com/omarsar/data_mining_lab) on **the new dataset**. You don't need to explain all the procedures as we did in the notebook, but you are expected to provide some **minimal comments** explaining your code. You are also expected to use the same libraries used in the first lab session. You are allowed to use and modify the `helper` functions we provided in the first lab session or create your own. Also, be aware that the helper functions may need modification as you are dealing with a completely different dataset. This part is worth 30% of your grade!\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition to applying the same operations from the first lab, we are asking that you attempt the following tasks on the new sentiment dataset as well (40%):\n",
    "    - Use your creativity and imagination to generate **new data visualizations**. Refer to online resources and the Data Mining textbook for inspiration and ideas. \n",
    "    - Generate **TF-IDF features** from the tokens of each text. Refer to this Sciki-learn [guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) on how you may go about doing this. Keep in mind that you are generating a matrix similar to the term-document matrix we implemented in our first lab session. However, the weights will be computed differently and should represent the TF-IDF value of each word per document as opposed to the word frequency.\n",
    "    - Using both the TF-IDF and word frequency features, try to compute the **similarity** between random sentences and report results. Read the \"distance simiilarity\" section of the Data Mining textbook on what measures you can use here. [Cosine similarity](https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/the-cosine-similarity-of-two-sentences/) is one of these methods but there are others. Try to explore a few of them in this exercise and report the differences in result. \n",
    "    - Lastly, implement a simple **Naive Bayes classifier** that automatically classifies the records into their categories. Try to implement this using scikit-learn built in classifiers and use both the TF-IDF features and word frequency features to build two seperate classifiers. Refer to this [nice article](https://hub.packtpub.com/implementing-3-naive-bayes-classifiers-in-scikit-learn/) on how to build this type of classifier using scikit-learn. Report the classification accuracy of both your models. If you are struggling with this step please reach us on Slack as soon as possible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presentation matters! You are also expected to **tidy up your notebook** and attempt new data operations and techniques that you have learned so far in the Data Mining course. Surprise us! This segment is worth 10% of your grade. The idea of this exercise is to begin thinking of how you will program the concepts you have learned and the process that is involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- After completing all the above tasks, you are free to remove this header block and **submit** your assignment following the guide provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/omarsar/dm_2018_hw_1/blob/master/README.md) file of the assignment's repository. "
